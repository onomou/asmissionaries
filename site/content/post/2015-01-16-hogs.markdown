There is a growing problem with wild hogs here. Over thirty of the families in the village have had their farms destroyed by a herd of the beasts over a hundred strong. The hogs eat the cassava and other root vegetables, and cassava alone takes nearly a year to mature once replanted. There are going to be a lot of hungry people in the village this year (we have been told that the government will be sending some aid, though soon may be a long time).
