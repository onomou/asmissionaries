This has become our new home. The people have been so friendly and accepting to us. When we landed on January 1, our friend Shadrack Reuben, his grandson Reynaldo, and several other villagers met us on the airstrip. Most of the people didn’t actually know that we were coming back at all, and so it was a big surprise for them to see us climb out of the plane. Many of the villagers have said things like “Welcome back home” since we have come back. It was such a joy to see their faces light up as they welcomed us back. What a blessing to have people who love and accept us even here.
