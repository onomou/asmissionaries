UPDATE
Kaden has been evaluated by a doctor and is under treatment. He has an IV running and has had medication to stop the vomiting.

Christine and the baby, Anneliese, are also sick, so please add them to your prayers. We are working on getting them all out. Because they are in Kamarang there should be a flight available by noon, so as long as Kaden stays stable they should be able to get out.

Thank you all for your prayers. "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but are mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds." 2 Corinthians 10:4.
