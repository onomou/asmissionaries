Dear Friends and Family,

This school year is finally winding down. Finals are over; the campus
is cleaned up and the kids have celebrated the end of school. We still
have to compile grades, but the big work is done and we are grateful
for the chance to rest a little. The Lord has brought us through
another term and we are so thankful for His care and help.

Now we are ready to move on to our next adventure--summer break at
home! The Lord has graciously provided us with funds to visit home,
and Lord willing we will arrive on the glorious Fourth of July in our
country where we can be thankful for the freedom to live and work and
worship according to the Word of God. We must never underestimate that
privilege, but pray and work to keep that freedom until the Lord's
times are accomplished.

We have not determined our whole schedule for the summer. Unless we
are invited elsewhere we will be spending most of our time in the
Pacific Northwest. If you would like to see pictures and hear stories
of our last year and more here, please contact us. We would love to
tell you more about what the Lord has done for us and the people of
Paruima.

Here is a rough breakdown of our plans so far:

July 6-17: Northern and Central California--this is a family camping
trip but we hope to do some visiting, too!
July 18-31: Spangle/Spokane, WA
August 1-5: Caldwell, Idaho

The rest of our time before we return is flexible. We have some health
training we are hoping to do, and Steven has some work lined up, but
if you would like to have us visit or spend some time together, please
let us know and we will try to work you in. Weekend camping trips or
hikes are great options for us! We miss all our friends and hope to do
lots of catching up.

We pray you have a restful and joyful Sabbath. Thank you so much for
your prayers, support, and encouragement. We could not do this without
each of you.

In His service,

Steven, Alice, and Grant Williams

PS: We're sorry there aren't any pictures in this update. Our internet
service is so slow now that it's impossible to attach any this time.
We hope to send or post pictures in a few weeks when we are back in
the States.
