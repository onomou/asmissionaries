Steven am filling in for a teacher who had to go back to the village. He teaches Form 1 Bible (1 class) and Math (2 classes). Alice is teaching a Form 1 Spelling and Grammar class. Form 1 is essentially 7th grade, though the years donâ€™t quite line up with the American system. The school currently has Forms 1-3, which will expand as the highest class progresses. Most students complete 5 or 6 forms, then take a set of exams in various subject areas, like Math, Biology, etc. We am still learning how the Guyanese system works.
