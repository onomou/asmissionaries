We’ve settled now. Not really settled, like on the old homestead, but at least our bed is made and there is food on the table. We have no Internet access, no grocery or hardware stores, no cell phones to distract us. Adjusting is hard. To know our two jars of peanut butter are the only two we have for the next several months is strangely frightening. And one is half gone already.

So much has happened over the last week and a half. I will try to recap the time since last post:

Thursday = "Our plane out of Atlanta was over an hour late. We missed the connection to Georgetown, spent several hours trying to figure out what to do about it, and finally got Delta to put us up in a hotel for the night. Flight rebooked for Friday afternoon. Slept easier knowing rounds were going to be alright."

Friday = "Got back to the airport before airline check-in opened. Ate a nice airport meal on Delta’s check. Then found out we couldn’t board our plane without a return flight. We have no intention of leaving Guyana in the near future, but airline rules do not care about that. Wait for an hour in line to buy refundable return tickets (combined account balance afterward, $150). Thankful God had the finances worked out already. All done, on the plane, in Georgetown asleep around midnight."

Sabbath = "Church on the other side of Georgetown. Wonderful, friendly people, and a good service."

PS = "This was super rushed. I’ll try to edit it later to make it more readable. Sorry!"
