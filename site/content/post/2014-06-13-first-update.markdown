Dear friends and family,

I am working on an account of our journey to Guyana, but I thought while I am working my way through that complicated narrative you might like to know how we are doing. In brie = we are doing well. Our house is comfortable, and while we are needing to get used to a different level of cleanliness (less clean for more work) we enjoy the fresh air and sunlight that pour in freely. It is hardest to get used to the dirt, which we never seem to fully remove. Cockroaches and mice leave droppings all over the kitchen and there aren’t enough cupboards to be able to have our food and our dishes be inside, so things must be rewashed often.

Yesterday the termites swarmed, flying inside and outside leaving their wings discarded all over the place. I don’t understand why they do this, and it makes the house feel so dirty, having wings on the counters and beds and floors.

It is the rainy season, and for the last several mornings torrential rains have awakened us at 4am. Today has been sunny, but I am still waiting for yesterday’s laundry to dry.

Hand washing all of our clothes is a new experience and I am not sure how best to do it yet. The water pressure is so low that it takes a very long time to get enough water for a good wash or rinse. It works well to wash in the river, but it’s a pain to haul everything down there. My hands are raw from wringing out cloth diapers and sheets yesterday. I’m glad I tried out our cloth diapers before I left home so I would know how to make them work best. Cleaning dirty diapers by hand is a difficult enough task without the added stress of not knowing how to avoid leaks and messes.

The Kamerang River flows by campus and we can see it from our upper balcony (both floors have balconies facing roughly west). The water of the river is dark with tannins but very clear and pretty clean from what we hear. I guess the tannins kill bacteria? The large rocks that abound in the river are quite free from slime, unusual in such a warm environment. The water is cool (I’m guessing about 75 degrees, but I can’t be certain) but not so cold that it is uncomfortable, and very deep in places. Swimming is a very refreshing pastime that we are trying to teach Grant to enjoy. The water has a slight, distinctive odor that makes our laundry smell a bit like hospital or hotel laundry–a very clean, fresh smell.

Speaking of smells, there are lots to get used to here. The rainforest is very alive and there are always the smells of green growth, flowers, and earth, as well as the smells of decaying vegetation and sometimes fruit. Our bodies smell different, and our home has a distinctive odor as well–not unpleasant, but inescapable. I guess it smells like any long-vacant wooden house would. The toilet has wooden boards supporting it and that room always smells a bit like stale urine. I have tried to scrub away the odor, but it hasn’t worked yet. I’d love to replace those boards, but there are more important projects at this point–like rerouting the toilet plumbing away from the kitchen counters, for example! The shower is broken and its plumbing leaks so we can’t shower without splashing water all over the kitchen counters below. Right now we are just using the river for baths, and we might keep that up for some time. It’s quicker than showers, but it’s too dark to swim after about 6:30 so if we want to bathe in the evening (almost a necessity after the hot, muggy days) we have to make sure we get it in early!

Three of our six trunks were left still in Georgetown until late last week, so we had to figure out how to make do without for now. Laura Fuller (the director’s wife) has been very gracious and helped us get some supplies so we could cook. I was very happy when my own cooking utensils arrived! Especially my kitchen knives….

We are enjoying learning how to get into coconuts. There is a steady supply of these on campus, though it’s harder to get the green ones. I am learning a great respect for the people who sell coconuts on the street for drinks–it’s not easy to neatly chop the top off a green coconut without losing any of the juice. It’s also not easy to peel a mature coconut. The husk is about two inches thick and it clings very tightly to the shell. I still haven’t done it myself–Steven gets that job right now. I intend to learn, though!

I am learning to cook on a propane stove. So far the biggest challenge is not having the capacity to simmer anything. Rice and quinoa will cook OK if brought to a rolling boil for a few minutes and then left to stand, covered, for another 20 minutes or so, but I am having a much harder time with beans. My pressure cooker was in another trunk, and now I  use it often!

Probably the best part of living here (so far) is the sweet sleep! We are always ready to sleep by the end of the day, and have not had any trouble drifting off, even once! Getting used to mosquito nets is another thing, but it’s not too bad, either. It gets dark in the evening at about 6:30 right now, and when we turn out the lights it gets really dark! We saw the Southern Cross our first night here (too cloudy the other nights) and we are  excited about learning the constellations we can see from this part of the world.

God has been so good to us. We are appreciating His love and care for us more every day. Thank you all for your prayers and support. We love you all.

In His service,
Alice, Steven, and Grant
