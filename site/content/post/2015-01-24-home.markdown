Three weeks have passed. We have moved into a little house far down the hill from the school classrooms and dormitories. This summer we hope to move closer, but our future abode needs some repairs first. Meanwhile we are trying to get really settled in our little home. We are working at pushing back the “bush” (jungle) that has been encroaching on the little house.

Several villagers have offered to help us cut back the bush and plant a little garden once the bush is gone. Again we are grateful for the kind people in our chosen home. Last Sunday two friends from the village came for 45 minutes in the morning to help cut bush, and you should have seen them go! They and Steven leveled a 50X75 foot area of small trees and undergrowth in record time—using no tools but machetes.

School started on Monday. Steven is teaching Math and English, and Alice is staying home to look after Grant and manage our household affairs. We look forward to a new year here in our new home, Paruima.
