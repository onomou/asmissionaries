Thank you all for your many and continued prayers. James and Christine have been able to board a flight in Kamarang and are on their way--Joy has just driven to go get them at Ogle airport. Pray they will arrive safely and be able to find good accommodations (we are crowded here at flight base, not even floor space for a fourth family.) Also, please pray that they will be able to find good medical care here. Pediatricians are rare and PICU unheard of. Many labs are unreliable, and we need to get these kids and Christine well again. Prayer works!

"Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God; and the peace of God, which transcends understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus." Philippians 4:6,7.
